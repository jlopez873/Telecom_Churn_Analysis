# Churn Analysis Project

This repository contains the code and data files for a churn analysis project, aimed at identifying key variables that contribute to customer churn. The project is divided into four main parts:

1. Data Acquisition
2. Data Exploration
3. Data Cleaning
4. Principal Component Analysis

## Getting Started
